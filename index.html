    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm a beginner</li>
        <li>I love to code.</li>
        <li>Ever since I was young, I had a different sorf of attraction towards computers and coding and how the world
            of internet works.</li>
        <li>So I chose something of my interest- <b>coding</b>! I'm now learning Front-end Web Development online and it
            is going pretty well so far!</li>
    </ul>

        examination. </p>

    <h3>Work experience:</h3>
    <p>I'm still a student learning to code. I'm prolly very young to do so. But I am loving this. I really love to
        learn things at the small age. I believe in the fact that <br> "You will always feel like you should've started
        at younger age. But today is the youngest you can ever be!" <br>
        So I guess yea that's my motivation for starting to code at the very young age.</p>

    <h3>Skills:</h3>
    <p>Well apart from coding and technical attraction, I love sports.</p>
