    <h3>Following are some of my hobbies:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I am National Archer. I won Gold Medal for my Country
        </li>
        <li>
            Talking about
            skills, I usually grasp things faster than average people because of my ambition and love for that
            particular
            project/goal. That's exactly how I took less time to learn Archery. So yes, I do learn things more precisely
            and faster because of my willingness to learn it.
        </li>
        <li>Along with national Gold medal and certificate, I have other tournaments medals</li>
        <li>I won many other state level
            games.</li>
        <li>I also received many certificates for national Olympiad examination as I am pretty good in maths lol!</li>
    </ul>
